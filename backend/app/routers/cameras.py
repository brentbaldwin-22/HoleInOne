"""Device-facing endpoints for on-course capture (always-on Pi
cameras). All routes auth via the per-Camera auth_token in the URL —
the admin password and user JWTs are not in scope here. Endpoints
are designed to be called by an unattended Python agent running on a
Raspberry Pi in the field; see docs/field-deployment.md for the
deployment plan and routers/admin.py for the operator-facing CRUD
that mints the tokens these routes accept.

Flow per session (a session covers a whole group's time on the tee
box — potentially many swings — not a single swing):

  1. Tee Pi detects a person in its tee-box ROI for >=2 s.
  2. Tee Pi POSTs /event-trigger with a session_id (UUID4) it
     generated. Backend creates a CameraEvent row and pushes the
     trigger into an asyncio.Queue keyed by the paired green camera's
     id. Tee Pi starts recording from its pre-roll buffer.
  3. Green Pi is sitting in /poll-trigger long-polling. It wakes up
     with the session_id, commits its pre-roll, keeps recording.
  4. Tee Pi keeps recording until its tee box has been empty for
     no_person_timeout_seconds (default 5 s). Then it POSTs
     /event-stop, releases the writer, and uploads. /event-stop sets
     stop_signal_at on the event row.
  5. Green Pi polls /event-status every ~1 s while recording. When
     stop_signal_at is non-null it releases its writer and uploads.
     There is a hard runaway-safety cap (default 10 min) on both Pis
     in case /event-stop never arrives (tee crash, network split).
  6. Both Pis upload their MP4s via /upload-event with the shared
     session_id. As soon as the second clip lands (or the only clip,
     for unpaired-tee single-camera setups), a background thread
     runs the existing _process_long_upload_segments pipeline. Since
     the raw clips can contain multiple swings, the worker first
     auto-detects them via the same audio+motion detector the long-
     upload flow uses and produces one VideoClip per detected swing.

State that lives in-memory only:
  _pending_triggers: dict[camera_id -> asyncio.Queue] — the wake-up
  queue for the long-poll. Lost on backend restart, which is fine:
  the tee Pi will retry; the green Pi reconnects to /poll-trigger on
  its next iteration. Single-instance deployment assumed (Replit).
