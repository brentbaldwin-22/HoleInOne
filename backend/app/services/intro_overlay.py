"""Intro overlay for processed swing clips.

Renders two panels onto the first ~3.5s of a clip:
  - Left: player name, course name, hole / par / yardage
  - Right: GolfReelz brand wordmark + flag icon

Both panels slide in from off-screen at t=0, hold for ~2.5s, then slide
back out by t=3.4s. The rest of the clip plays normally underneath.

Implementation:
  1. Render each panel as a transparent PNG via PIL (one-shot, ~50 ms
     of work).
  2. ffmpeg overlay filter composites both onto the input video with
     time-based x-position expressions for the slide animation.

Best-effort: every public function returns False / a no-op on failure
so the caller can keep shipping the underlying video even if the
overlay step breaks.

# WHY THERE IS A NAME AT ALL when nobody has been identified. The intro
# panel is a layout, and a blank where the name goes does not read as
# "unknown player", it reads as broken software. So a clip that matched
# no registered participant gets a stand-in.
#
# THE STAND-IN USED TO BE THE OWNER'S OWN NAME, hard-coded in five
# places, which meant every demo clip of every golfer on the range went
# out under one person's name. Plainly wrong on a shared clip and
# confusing on a review screen.

# professionals: a placeholder that reads as a real golfer somebody
# could look up is a worse placeholder, not a better one.
