# GolfReelz Pi capture agent (Phase 3)

The unattended Python service that runs on each Raspberry Pi to feed
the GolfReelz backend. One agent codebase, two roles — the role is
chosen at runtime from the camera's backend registration:

- **Tee Pi**: reads the camera feed continuously, runs MediaPipe Pose
  at 5 fps, triggers when a person enters the configured tee-box ROI
  for ≥ 2 s. Persists a 5 s pre-roll + everything until the person
  leaves, then uploads.
- **Green Pi**: continuously buffers 5 s of frames in RAM, long-polls
  the backend for triggers, commits the buffer + records 12 s on
  trigger, then uploads.

Both share the same config schema, the same HTTP client, the same
systemd unit. The only operational difference is which `auth_token`
(tee or green from `/admin/cameras`) you put in `config.yaml`.

## Architecture recap

```
[GoPro / Pi Camera] ──> [Pi 5 running this agent] ──HTTPS──> Backend
                            │
                            ├─ POST /api/cameras/{token}/heartbeat   (60s)
                            ├─ POST /api/cameras/{token}/event-trigger  (tee, on detect)
                            ├─ GET  /api/cameras/{token}/poll-trigger   (green, long-poll)
                            └─ POST /api/cameras/{token}/upload-event   (both, after record)
```

The backend handles cutting, AI tracer, dual-cam composite, intro
overlay, share buttons, matching to players — see
`docs/field-deployment.md` and `backend/app/routers/cameras.py`.

## Setup (fresh Pi)

Assuming you've flashed Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Bookworm or newer)
onto an SD card, set Wi-Fi / SSH in the imager, and booted the Pi.

```bash
# 1. SSH into the Pi
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local

# 2. Copy this directory to /opt/golfreelz-agent (e.g. via scp from
#    your laptop, or git clone the repo + symlink). For first-time
#    test you can just clone the whole HoleInOne repo:
sudo mkdir -p /opt/golfreelz-agent
sudo chown -R "$USER:$USER" /opt/golfreelz-agent
cd /opt/golfreelz-agent
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/brentbaldwin-22/HoleInOne tmp
mv tmp/pi-agent/* tmp/pi-agent/.* . 2>/dev/null || true
rm -rf tmp

# 3. Run the installer (apt deps + venv + service user + systemd)
sudo bash /opt/golfreelz-agent/install.sh

# 4. Create config.yaml with this device's auth_token + backend URL
sudo cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
sudo nano config.yaml   # fill in backend_url, auth_token, tee_box_roi

# 5. Start the agent
sudo systemctl start golfreelz-agent
sudo journalctl -u golfreelz-agent -f
```

The agent will log its first heartbeat, then either start the tee or
green main loop based on the role the backend returned for this
token.

## Finding the tee-box ROI

Only required for tee cameras. The ROI is a rectangle in the
camera's captured frame (pixel coords, origin top-left) — anything
inside that rectangle counts as "on the tee box."

After mounting the camera in its final position:

```bash
# Snap a sample frame
cd /opt/golfreelz-agent
sudo -u golfreelz ./venv/bin/python3 -c "import cv2; \
  cap=cv2.VideoCapture(0); cap.set(3,1920); cap.set(4,1080); \
  ok,f=cap.read(); cv2.imwrite('/tmp/frame.jpg', f); print('saved')"

# Copy /tmp/frame.jpg back to your laptop, open in an image editor,
# draw a rectangle around the tee markers, note the pixel coords.
# Plug them into config.yaml as tee_box_roi.x/y/w/h.
```

## Checking focus

The HQ camera (IMX477) has **no autofocus** — focus and aperture are
physical rings on the C/CS lens. `focus.py` gives you a number to tune
against instead of squinting at a preview on a laptop in sunlight.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop golfreelz-agent        # the service holds the camera
cd /opt/golfreelz-agent
sudo -u golfreelz ./venv/bin/python3 focus.py --roi tee --save /tmp/focus.jpg
# ... turn the focus ring slowly, stop where `score` peaks, Ctrl-C ...
sudo systemctl start golfreelz-agent
```

Output looks like:

```
score    1284  (best    1301)  [###################  ]  bright 118  zones L 940 C 1284 R 1102
```

- **score** — sharpness right now. The absolute value means nothing across
  scenes; only its **peak as you turn the ring** matters.
- **best** — highest seen this run, so you can tell you have gone past it.
- **zones** — left/centre/right thirds. A large spread means the camera
  isn't square to the scene, or the lens is soft off-axis (stopping the
  aperture down usually fixes the latter).
- **bright** — mean luma. Below ~40 or above ~220 the score is unreliable;
  fix exposure first.

Three things look identical in a finished clip, and this separates them:

| What you see | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| A *static* object at the golfer's distance scores low here | focus | the lens ring |
| Scores fine here, but *moving* things smear in the video | motion blur | `shutter_us` in config.yaml — see below |
| Scores fine and the saved 100% crop is sharp, but the uploaded clip is soft | compression | bitrate (green uploads 720p @ 1500 kbps) |

**If the saved `_crop100.jpg` is sharp, focus is not the problem.**

### Shutter speed and the ball against a pale sky

The tracer finds the ball with a frame-to-frame difference thresholded
at 8 grey levels. A struck ball crosses ~1100px/s in the tee frame, so
under auto-exposure on an overcast day — a long shutter — a 4px ball
smears across ~18px at 1/60s, and each pixel along that smear only sees
the ball for a fifth of the exposure. Its contrast against the sky
arrives divided by five.

Against blue sky the ball still clears the threshold. Against a bright
pale overcast sky, where the ball is only 20-30 levels brighter than the
background to begin with, it does not, and no chain forms. This is why
detection is sky-dependent rather than random.

Pin the shutter in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
camera:
  shutter_us: 2000      # 1/500s
```

1/500s takes the smear to about 2px, which is under the ball's own size —
shorter than that wins nothing and only adds noise, since three stops of
shutter is roughly eight times the gain.

Not every driver accepts manual exposure through libcamerify's V4L2
shim. Check what yours exposes, and read the agent's own log line back
after restarting:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop golfreelz-agent
libcamerify v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --list-ctrls   # look for exposure_time_absolute
sudo systemctl start golfreelz-agent
journalctl -u golfreelz-agent -n 50 | grep "camera shutter"
```

`camera shutter: asked for 2000µs (1/500 s), driver reports 2000µs` means
it took. A warning that the driver reports nothing back means this path
does not control exposure on your camera, and the shutter has to be set
through Picamera2 instead — which needs the agent venv rebuilt with
`--system-site-packages`, since `python3-picamera2` is an apt package and
`install.sh` builds an isolated venv.

Two things worth doing while you are out there:

- **Stop the aperture down.** Wide open (f/1.2 on the 6mm CS lens) the
  depth of field is very shallow and the corners are soft. Around f/4–5.6
  sharpens the frame and buys enough depth that the ball at address and
  the ball a few yards downrange are both acceptable. In daylight you have
  light to spare.
- **Focus through the enclosure**, at the real mounting distance — acrylic
  shifts the focal plane slightly and shows up any haze or condensation.

Lock both rings with their grub screws when done; transport walks them.

## Updating the agent code

```bash
# Default: pull main + restart the service
sudo /opt/golfreelz-agent/update.sh

# Or pull a specific branch / tag
sudo /opt/golfreelz-agent/update.sh some-feature-branch
```

`update.sh` clones the repo into a tmp dir, stops the service, copies
the agent files into place, refreshes pip requirements, and restarts.
It only touches code under `agent/` plus the top-level entry script —
`config.yaml`, the systemd unit, and any other local edits are left
alone.

If `update.sh` itself is missing (e.g. on a Pi installed before it
existed), one-time bootstrap:

```bash
sudo curl -fsSL -o /opt/golfreelz-agent/update.sh \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brentbaldwin-22/HoleInOne/main/pi-agent/update.sh
sudo chmod +x /opt/golfreelz-agent/update.sh
sudo chown golfreelz:golfreelz /opt/golfreelz-agent/update.sh
```

After that, every future update is just `sudo /opt/golfreelz-agent/update.sh`.

## Troubleshooting

- **`initial heartbeat failed: 404`** — the `auth_token` in
  `config.yaml` doesn't match any camera on the backend. Re-check
  the token in `/admin/cameras` (or rotate it there and update
  `config.yaml`).
- **`backend returned unknown assigned_role`** — the camera exists
  but its `assigned_role` is something other than `tee` or `green`.
  Set it correctly via `/admin/cameras`.
- **`mediapipe not importable — falling back to motion-density`** —
  MediaPipe didn't install (most often: 32-bit Pi OS on a Pi 3 / armv7).
  The motion-fallback detector keeps the network plumbing testable
  but is much noisier in production. Either install a 64-bit Pi OS
  or limit deployment to Pi 4 / Pi 5.
- **GoPro USB-C not detected as `/dev/video*`** — make sure the
  GoPro is set to *USB-webcam* mode (Hero 11+ supports this out of
  the box; older Heros need GoPro Labs firmware). Plug the USB-C
  cable in *while the GoPro is off*, then power it on; the Pi sees
  it as a UVC device.
- **Recordings are upside-down / mirrored** — most cameras don't
  rotate automatically. If you need to rotate, edit
  `agent/common.py:open_camera` to wrap the cap in a rotating
  decorator (one-liner with `cv2.rotate`).

## What this doesn't do (yet)

- **PIR sleep cycle** — the production tier in
  `docs/field-deployment.md` describes wake-on-PIR for indefinite
  solar operation. Not built; the agent runs flat-out. Add it later
  by gating the main loop on a GPIO input.
- **OTA updates** — the agent doesn't pull new code on its own.
  Re-deploy manually via SSH for now.
- **Per-event diagnostics** — failures log to the journal but don't
  surface anywhere the operator can see. Pair this with the Phase
  2 admin pages (camera card shows `last_seen_at` + last event
  status) for now; a richer per-event view is on the roadmap.
