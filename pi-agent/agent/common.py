# rate against a 45s timeout. Every chunk that hit a slow patch died on
# the timeout and re-sent the whole 512 KB from scratch, because there
# is no partial credit WITHIN a chunk. One clip sat at 82% for 36
# minutes that way while the link was moving data the entire time.

# Capture-mode presets for the Pi HQ Camera (IMX477). The sensor's
# native modes: full-width 2x2 binned 2028x1080 sustains ~50fps, and the
# cropped 1332x990 mode reaches 120fps. Frame rate is pure gold for the
# ball tracer — at 30fps a driven ball crosses hundreds of pixels
# between frames; at 50-60 you get ~2x the track points, half the
# per-frame motion, and less blur smearing the ball into the grass.
# Cost: bigger uploads (same bitrate, more even quality if you bump
# upload_bitrate_kbps) and a bigger RAM pre-roll buffer.
# NOTE on widths: the V4L2 -> OpenCV path needs 32-aligned row widths.
# Requesting the sensor-native 2028/1332 widths produced stride-corrupted
# frames (horizontal smearing) — so every preset asks the ISP for an
# ALIGNED output size while libcamera picks the fast sensor mode
# underneath (1920x1080@50 still runs the 2028x1080 binned 50fps mode).
# ENCODER BUDGET (measured on a Pi 5, mp4v via OpenCV, thermally
# throttled at ~85C): ~31 fps of 1080p. The camera itself delivers a
# rock-steady 50 fps even while throttled — the SOFTWARE ENCODER is
# the pipeline's ceiling, so a mode is only usable if the encoder can
# keep up with it. 720p is ~2.25x cheaper per frame, which is what

        WHY THIS EXISTS. The tee's uplink is a USB cellular modem that
        reboots every ~30 seconds under load — ~23s alive at ~125 KB/s,
        then ~8s gone while it re-enumerates on the USB bus. A 6.5 MB
        clip needs ~52s of live wire. It therefore CANNOT complete
        inside one modem lifetime, and every whole-file POST spent its
        timeout in a dead window and discarded everything it had sent.
        The clip that failed thirty times was never too big for the
        link; it was too big for the link's uptime.

        Chunks are ~4s of wire each, so a reset costs one chunk, not the
        whole clip, and the next window picks up where the last left
        off. Progress is banked on the SERVER, so it also survives the
        agent restarting.

    # WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS. Auto-exposure on an overcast
    # day picks a long shutter, and a struck ball crosses ~1100px/s in
    # this frame -- so at 1/60s it smears over ~18px while the ball
    # itself is about 4. Every pixel along that smear sees the ball for
    # only a fifth of the exposure, so the ball's contrast against the
    # sky arrives divided by five. The band detector thresholds a
    # frame-to-frame difference at 8 grey levels; against blue sky the
    # ball clears that even smeared, against a pale overcast sky it
    # does not, and the chain never forms. Shortening the shutter
    # concentrates the same photons into fewer pixels: at 1/500s the
    # smear is ~2px and the contrast comes back almost whole.
    #
    # The cost is gain. Three stops of shutter is eight times the gain
    # and roughly 2.8x the noise, so this buys about 1.6x in true
    # signal-to-noise -- but against a FIXED 8-level threshold it is
    # the contrast that decides, and that goes up 4-5x. Below about
    # 1/1000 there is nothing left to win: the smear is already
    # shorter than the ball, and only the noise keeps climbing.
