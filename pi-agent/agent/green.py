"""Green-side capture agent. Continuously buffers frames in RAM and
long-polls the backend for triggers. When a trigger arrives (sent by
the paired tee's event-trigger call), commits the pre-roll buffer and
keeps recording until the tee's /event-stop hits the backend (polled
once per second via /event-status), then uploads.

The duration of one session is therefore variable — it matches what
the tee Pi recorded, which itself ends when the tee box has been
empty for no_person_timeout_seconds. A hard runaway cap
(max_clip_seconds, default 10 min) bounds the recording in case the
stop signal never arrives (tee crash, network split).

No person detection here — the trigger comes from the tee Pi, so the
green just has to be recording when the ball lands."""
