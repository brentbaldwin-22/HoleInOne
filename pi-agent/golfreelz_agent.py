"""GolfReelz Pi capture agent — entry point.

Loads config.yaml (or the path passed as the first arg), dispatches
to the tee or green runner based on the role the backend assigns to
this camera's auth_token.

Usage:
    python3 golfreelz_agent.py [/path/to/config.yaml]

The role is determined at runtime: the first heartbeat returns the
camera's assigned_role, and the agent picks tee.run() or green.run()
based on that. So a single SD-card image works for both deployment
positions — only the config.yaml differs.
